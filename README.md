# RCCG-MEMBERSHIP-SYSTE
Database used h2bc
This Application was developed using Java Swing Library and it is used to save record of members in the church. 
It is developed for a branch of The Redeemed Christian Church of God.
Currently the basic requirements are complete but i need to add functionalities to 
be able to upload records from a csv file like Microsoft Excel into the database

All contributions are welcome
